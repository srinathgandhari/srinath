promise:
--A promise is a special js object that represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation
--it allows to handle aynchronous tasks more efficiently that callbacks

3 STATES:

1)pending: The initial state,the promise is still waiting for the operation to finish
2)fullfilled:the operation completed successfully
3)rejected:the operation failed;

Exp:
1)to create a promise - new promise()
it uses 2 parameters-
resolve--to mark the promise as successfully
reject-mark it as failed

2)handling the result:
.then() method is called when promise is fullfilled
it will receives the result from resolve()
.catch() method is called if the promise is rejected
it receives the error message from reject()

example:

let mypromise = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
let success=true;
if(success){
resolve("the operation is successfull);
}else{
reject("the operation failed")
}
});
mypromise
.then(result=>{
console.log(result);
});
.catch(error=>{
console.log(error);
});


chaining promises:
Ex:

let promise=new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
resolve(5);
//initial resolve value is 5
})
promise
.then(result=>{
console.log(result);
return result *2
//return a new value
})
.then(result=>{
console.log(result);
return result +3
//return a new value
})
.then(result=>{
console.log(result);
})
.catch(error=>{
console.log("error",error)
})

Ex:promise with setTimeOut
--asyncchronous task using setTimeOut, and the promise will resolve after a certain amount od time
let pro=new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
        resolve(5);
    })
    pro.then(result=>{
        console.log(result)
        setTimeout((pro)=>{
            console.log("success")
        },3000)
    }
